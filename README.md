# Machine Learning Projects - AIUB

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed as part of the **Machine Learning** course at **American International University - Bangladesh (AIUB)**. It includes various Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the implementation of machine learning algorithms and techniques, with a final project housed in the `/Final/Project` folder.

### Course Information
For more details on the course, refer to the [AIUB Undergraduate Course Catalog](https://www.aiub.edu/faculties/fst/ug-course-catalog).  
*Note: Search for "Machine Learning" for specific course information.*

## Project Overview

The repository explores a range of machine learning concepts from basic models to more advanced techniques. The projects are implemented using popular libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Final Project:
The `/Final/Project` folder contains the capstone project for this course, which involves the implementation of a machine learning pipeline to solve a real-world problem using appropriate algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation metrics.
